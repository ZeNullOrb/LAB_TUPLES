# LAB_TUPLES

- Create a tuple called numbers that contains the integers 1, 2, and 3.
- Create a tuple called letters that contains the strings "a", "b", and "c".
- Print out the first item in the numbers tuple.
- Print out the last item in the letters tuple.
- Use the + operator to concatenate the numbers and letters tuples. Store the result in a new tuple called result.
- Print out the length of the result tuple.
- Use the in keyword to check if the integer 4 is in the result tuple.
- Use the tuple() function to convert a list of integers [4, 5, 6] into a tuple.
- Use tuple unpacking to save the values of the above tuple into variables. 

# Bonus : 
in the LAB_TUPLES , do the following:
- Use the index() method to find the index of the string "b" in the letters tuple. 
- Use the count() method to find the number of occurrences of the integer 2 in the result tuple.
- Use the enumerate() function to iterate over the result tuple, along with its index, and print out each item and its index.
